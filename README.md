# Joint Propagation Model
The Joint propagation model (JPM) is a model developed for deriving a harmonized quantification of tau PET data across different tracers. The JPM simultaneously use head-to-head data and anchor point data to estimate equations for mapping regional SUVRs to a harmonized scale named *CenTauRs*. 

The JPM is implemented in the R and C++ using the [Template Model Builder](https://kaskr.github.io/adcomp/_book/Introduction.html) framework.
